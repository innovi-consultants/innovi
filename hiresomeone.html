			<h2>Hire Someone Already! Google Ventures Mulls Its European Moves</h2>
			<img src="images/keepcalm-geton.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
			<p class="para">As the cream of Europe’s entrepreneurs filed into the beautifully lit room at a European tech conference late in 2012, picking up their champagne as they went, a VC leaned over to Welsey Chan of Google Ventures and asked:“Why on earth are you guys sponsoring these drinks? You don’t have any investments in Europe, do you?”. Turning to his interrogator, Chan replied: “Not yet.” Thus it was that rumours started circulating around what Google Ventures might be planning in Europe.</p>
			<p class="para">Fast forward to March this year, and amid the Caribbean-themed annual birthday party for Google’s Campus London — the co-working space created in the heart of East London’s ‘Tech City’ area — two figures wandered amongst the crowd, brushing shoulders with the likes of the Duke of York and other dignitaries. GV General Partners Bill Maris and Rich Miner weren’t just over for drinks. They had come to figure out GV’s next moves.</p>
            <p class="para">Over the next few days and weeks Maris and Miner set about working their way through the most active VCs, angels and entrepreneurs in the London and Berlin tech startup industry, looking for people who fit Google’s particularly quirky way of operating. For since Google Ventures’ founding in 2009, it’s taken on board a more unusual array of partners than the average corporate fund, hiring early stage investors, former entrepreneurs and even luring technology journalists. Amid the corridors and at the parties of the European tech scene the question on everyone’s lips was: would it make the same play in Europe as it had in the U.S.?</p>
            <p class="para">Gossip, rumours and speculation have been rife. Yesterday, freelance writer Milo Yiannopoulos has ‘called’ what he says will be the line-up for Google Ventures Europe, naming a number of high-profile people.</p>
            <p class="para">When contacted, a Google spokesperson told me they would not be commenting on what they described as “rumour and speculation”.</p>
            <p class="para">However, while the jungle drums are strong on parts of this story, there remains enormous variation in the stories coming out from TechCrunch’s sources. For one, our sources say GV has talked to almost “everyone” in the European tech scene regarding their roll-out. So naming names at this stage looks premature. </p>
            <p class="para">That said, we’ve checked with our sources and here’s what we’ve found:</p>
             <p class="para">The industry chatter is that Google Ventures Europe’s fund is likely to be somewhere between $100-$150 million. In the US the fund is $300m, so a European operation is likely to be around half the size given that, believe it or not. With less repeat entrepreneurs and a younger ecosystem, it’s still hard to deploy the same amount of capital in Europe as in the U.S.</p>
             <p class="para">But Google Ventures won’t operate like a pure-play VC fund in Europe. Typically, these might be deployed over several years. But as a corporate fund, Google Ventures is an ‘evergreen’ fund — a line-item on Google’s annual budget, not ‘raised’ like a normal VC fund from limited partners.</p>
             <p class="para">Meanwhile, it’s the team that the rumor-mills are focusing on.</p>
